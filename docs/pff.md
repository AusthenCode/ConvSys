# Virtual Conveyor System Simulation - Austin Shelton

---

## Project Description

Modern manufacturing relies heavily on conveyor systems for efficient product movement.  
However, physical testing and operator training can be expensive and risky.

This project proposes a **fully virtual conveyor system** that allows users to:
- Safely control conveyors through virtual control stations
- Simulate complex conveyor interactions 
- Syrnchonize mulitple applications to achieve full system integration

---

# Project Objectives

The virtual conveyor system will enable:
- Safe and cost-effective testing
- Real-time system monitoring
- Operator training in a simulated environment
- Integration of PLC logic, simulation, and HMI platforms

---

# Key Features 

## 1. PLC-Based Conveyor Control
- Develop ladder logic % structuredText using Studio 5000
- Control motors, sensors, and safety interlocks
- Ensure proper sequencing of conveyor operations
- Implement tracking, HSD, MU, etc...

## 2. Virtual Control Stations
- Create virtual control stations using FactoryTalk View
- Provide start,stop, jam and speed control
- Display conveyor status in real time

---
# Key Features

## 3. Emergency Stop & Safety Logic
- Integrate E-stop buttons and safety interlocks
- Immediately halt/cascade conveyors on faults
- Display alarms and notifications on the HMI


## 4. System Integration
- Synchronize PLC logic, Emulate3D, FactoryTalk, and Ignition
- Ensure real-time communication across platforms
- Test system reliability under different scenarios

---

## 5. Documentation & Reporting
- Maintain full project documentation
- Include PLC logic diagrams and HMI screenshots
- Prepare presentation and demo materials

---

# Development Roadmap
