# Virtual Conveyor System Simulation - Austin Shelton

---

## Project Description

Modern manufacturing relies heavily on conveyor systems for efficient product movement.  
However, physical testing and operator training can be expensive and risky.

This project proposes a **fully virtual conveyor system** that allows users to:
- Safely control conveyors through virtual control stations
- Simulate complex conveyor interactions 
- Syrnchonize mulitple applications to achieve full system integration
